Download and install Unity3D, if you want to compile for Mac, Windows or Android there are options in the installer.
Donwload or clone this repository.
Create a Folder some where in your system and copy there the EDK.dll (If your machine its 64 bits use x64 version, else use x86)
Add a system variable using the path of the folder you just created. This depends on you OS, so you have to find out the specific way for your system.
Compile the DotNetEmotivSDK.
5.1. Got to the C# forder in the repository copy on your machine and open the DotNetEmotivSDK project with Visual Studio.
5.2. Right click on the project DotNetEmotivSDK in the Solution Explorer (Right Panel), click on Properties.
5.3. On the Application Tab, select Target Framework to .Net Framework 3.5 (The default that Unity Uses), save changes (Ctrl+S).
5.4. Right click on the project DotNetEmotivSDK in the Solution Explorer, select Build.
5.5. Go to the project folder /bin/Debug or /bin/Release and search for the DotNetEmotivSDK.dll.
Add the compiled DotNetEmotivSDK.dll to the assets folder in Unity, when scripting add the "using Emotiv;" statement.
Done, you can write code using the Emotiv library.


Follow this steps.

Now there is no error but fix the message box at bottom. 

Makesure for using proper edk.dll in C:\Emotiv and the SDK under the Assets folder on unity.
